**Android / Security / System design**


My education at Georgia State University, along with building things out the traphouse, has served as a catalyst for my technical growth, 
furnishing me with a robust foundation in system design, programming, and networking. 
I prayed for the ability to translate theoretical knowledge into practical solutions.

Thats all I want to do.
